# TO DO LIST

## OVERVIEW
In this project, I will be creating a to-do list where the user can create his goals and things to do in near future or bigger future and after achieving that he can strike off the goal or delete it from the list. 

## TECH USED
Flutter and dart language will be used as the programming language for this project. Also for the simulation android studio or more preferable visual studio code will be used.

## USAGE GUIDE
* Run the flutter project on any emulator.
* To strike out an element from the list click on the checkbox on the left side of each item.
* To delete an item from the list, slide the item to the left and then the delete option appears  ,click on it to delete.
* To add a new item to the list, click on the plus sign on the bottom right hand corner and    enter the new task and click on the save button to add, then click on the cross button to close the add new task drop down box.

## GOALS
* Create a structured way to achieve goals
* Helping the user to list all his goals
* By seeing all the goals together , the user will always have in mind what he has to achieve  and not miss or forget any one goal.
* By letting the user strike off a goal, it will give them satisfaction that they have completed it and motivate them to complete more goals.
