# BLADE FROGGER

## OVERVIEW
It is a game where a person has to cross the road, where many cars are going from left to right and right to left. If the user is able to make the person cross the road using arrow keys then he will get a score and then again he will have to cross the road. The number of times he crosses the road the greater the score will be. If he gets hit by a car then the game is over and he can see his total score.

## TECH USED
I will use GD script to write the code for the game and use the Godot Engine 3 version to create an environment to run the game.

## GAME ACTIONS
* To start the game, download Godot 3 in your system, download the github repository and run the project.
* Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character up,down,left,right
* If any car touches the character then the game is over.
* If the character is able to cross all the road to the other side then he is granted one score and is restarted automatically to the starting position.
* Once the game over screen shows with your final score , press the spacebar button to restart the game.

## UI MOCKUP
