# METEOR SHOOTER

## OVERVIEW
It is a game where a spaceship will be there and there will be many meteors falling down and we have to shoot it with the spaceshipâ€™s laser. The laser takes 1 sec to recoil. One will reduce its health points if the spaceship crashes with the meteor. There will be health points, if you lose all then your game is over and you will get your score.

## TECH USED
I will use the python programming language to build the game and in it I will be using the pygame,random and system libraries.
  
## GAME ACTIONS
* To start the game , execute and run the python code.
* Move the mouse on the game screen to move the spaceship and click on any mouse button to shoot the laser.
* The spaceship takes 0.5seconds to charge the laser and once the laser is charged, you can see a yellow outline around the spaceship.
* If your spaceship is hit by a meteor then you lose a health point out of 5 health points which will be present on the top left hand corner of the screen.
* Once you lose all health points your game is over and you can see your score which is the number of meteors that you have hit.
* You can press any mouse button to restart the game.
* To exit from the game , press on the cross button of the game screen at the top right hand corner of the screen.
